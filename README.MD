## The BS I am doing(did) for my TOEFL prep on boosters

Nothing special here. This is just for my personal reference.

## Parts of the TOEFL:

- Reading Section (where most of us never want to mess up)
- Listening Section (where most of us are never supposed to mess up but we do)
- Speaking Section (where most of us mess up)
- Writing Section (where most of us don't know how we mess up)

## Scores:

- 30 for each section, making to a 120
- For a bare minimum, a 24 on each section is a must
- For clearing cutoff of most colleges, a 25 on each section is a must
- For dream colleges , a 26 or 27 on each section is a must
- For dope scholarship, a 28 or 29 on each section is a must
- For bragging rights,a 117-120 is a must

## Writing Section:

### Task 1: 

- __3 min__ : to read a passage. This will again be provided later
- The passage is split in to 4 paras
   - Para 1: Intro stating an opinion (Skim through the most. Last 1-2 lines are to be focussed)
   - Para 2: Reason 1 (Skim through the most. First 1-2 lines are to be focussed)
   - Para 3: Reason 2 (Skim through the most. First 1-2 lines are to be focussed)
   - Para 4: Reason 3 (Skim through the most. First 1-2 lines are to be focussed)
- __1 min__: to listen to a professor's lecture (who always opposes the opinion expressed here)
- __some seconds__: Question (How does the professor refute/oppose the opinion expressed in the paragraph)


#### Approach:

###### Scratch Paper:

|PASSAGE(P)|LECTURE(L)|
|---------|-----------|
|Opinion(O)|Counter Opinion(CO)|
|Reason 1(R1) | Counter Reason 1 (CR1) |
|Reason 2(R2) | Counter Reason 3 (CR3) |
|Reason 3(R3) | Counter Reason 3 (CR3) |


##### Template:

The article states that .... and provides three reasons of support.
However, the professor explains that... and refutes each of the author's reasons

First the reading claims that ....... The professor refutes this point by saying that... The professor further explains ...

Second the article posists that ... However, the professor says that... According to the professor....

Third the reading says that... The professors opposes this point by expaining that...We also learn that ...

#### Suggestions:

- Paraphrasing in not important
- Repitition of points does not help
- Conclusion is optional
- Aim for a 350-550 words essay


### Task 2:

Given a topic, state your opinion and give reasons to support it with example 

##### Template:


| Task | Timer | Time Spent |
|------|-------|------------|
| [__PRE WRITING__ : Planning] | 27 | 3 min |
|Introduction | 23 | 4 min |
| Reason 1 + 2-3 Examples | 15 | 8 min |
| Reason 2 + 2-3 Examples | 7  | 8 min |
| Conclusion| 4 | 4 min |
| Fix up | 0 | 4 min |

The `Introduction` answers the following questions:

- What is the topic?
- What is the question?
- What is your opinion?
- What are your reasons?

** Try to answer in 3-5 sentences. More marks for complex sentences.

- There should be transition between paragraphs. Like Furthermore, In addition to, Moreover,
- Conclusion could be started with: To conclude, Thus, Therefore, 
- Word Count should be from 500-650. Make it happen
